Binaries builds by Jonah Friedman provided for Windows 64, for 4.0.x and 4.1.x. 
4.1 binaries will work in Arnold 4.2 as well. Linux builds by Vladimir Jankijevic and 
Benoit Leveau. OS X build by Jan Walter.

To download as a user: Download the entire repo as a zip, using the "download as
zip" button on the right sidebar of the github page. Then move the appropriate binaries
and helper files (found under source) into the right directories of Softimage or Maya.
Note: If you instead download individual files from github, you may accidentally 
download HTML files instead of the actual raw files, which of course won't work.


Contributions, questions, and suggestions are also welcomed.

Release Notes:

1.0.1:
	Fixes a bug causing a crash when there are two perfectly overlapping pieces
	of geometry, such as duplicate geometry. 

1.0.2:
	Fixed a bug where shadow rays were evaluating wrong if they originated from
	inside nested dielectric, for example a standard shader embedded in some nested
	dielectric glass. 

	Fixed a crash that occurred with perfectly overlapping geometry inside of a nested
	surface, and fixed a crash with huge numbers of overlapping geometries. 

1.0.3:
	Fixed a new bug in Arnold 4.2 where Cook-Torrance speculars would render incorrectly
	(due to the inclusion of Anisotropic Cook-Torrance.)
	
	Note: Arnold 4.1 is binary compatible with Arnold 4.2, so there are no new binaries for 4.2.
